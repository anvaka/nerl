This folder contains examples of envisioned API.
Each example has `in` and `out` folder.

* `in` shows what developers write.
* `out` shows result of browserified package.

*Note* This folder contains prove of concept only. I had to tweak browserified output
to add missing functionality. This manual work can be definitely automated.

* [00 - clock javascript](00%20-%20clock%20javascript) - Shows how to create a basic
clock component from JavaScript and attach it to the parent dom element.
* [01 - clock html](01%20-%20clock%20html) - Shows how to attach clock component
directly from html, via declarative `require` markup.
