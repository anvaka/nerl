This repository is work in progress.

I'm trying to build HTML components infrstructure, which leverages power of npm.

I've seen already:

* [W3 Intro to Web Components](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) -  non-normative reference, which provides an overview of Web Components (Templates, Decorators, Custom Elements, Shadow DOM and imports)
* [Component](https://github.com/component/component) - client package management for building better web applications
* [Atomify](https://github.com/Techwraith/atomify) - An atomic web development tool - keep all your templates, css, and js for each node module together
* [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) - Call all Node.js modules directly from DOM and enable a new way of writing applications with all Web technologies.
* [Handlebars partials](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/handlebars-js-part-2-partials-and-helpers) - partials in handlebars.js

This repository is different
